\phSection{Puzzle Packet and ClueKeeper}

This printed \textbf{Puzzle Packet} contains all the physical
puzzle materials you'll need to play the game. But you'll
also need to download this hunt on \textbf{ClueKeeper} app to solve them!

Once you've downloaded the hunt on your app, you can add as many teammates
as you want via the menu. Once your team is ready, you can use the
\textbf{Start Code} \texttt{MINDY} to begin the game.
Once the game begins, clues will become available in the app that
will allow your team to begin solving puzzles in this packet. Once a puzzle is
solved, its solution can be submitted via the app. Hints
for puzzles are also available in the app.

\phSection{Main Puzzles}

Once the game begins, you'll be presented with four \textbf{Main Puzzles}. 
Each Main Puzzle can be solved directly using mathematical 
problem-solving abilities. Once the solution for the puzzle has been
entered into ClueKeeper, \textbf{1000 Victory Points} will be awarded,
and the second part will be unlocked. This second part uses the first
solution to extract a short word or phrase. Solving this second challenge
is worth an additional \textbf{500 Victory Points}.

\phSection{Cryptic Puzzles}

After solving the second part of each Main Puzzle, an additional
\textbf{Cryptic Puzzle} will become available to solve.
The way to solve these puzzles is left, well,
cryptic. However, your team should still be able to use your
critical thinking to extract a hidden word or phrase. Correct
solutions are worth \textbf{500 Victory Points}.

\phSection{Metapuzzle}

Once your team has solved two Cryptic Puzzles, the final \textbf{Metapuzzle}
becomes available, worth \textbf{1500 Victory Points}.

\phSection{Goal of the Game}

Your team's goal is to submit solutions for all the puzzles in the
app, earning \textbf{all 10000 Victory Points} and completing
the story.
