Campuses that wish to use GPS to unlock puzzles should provide
a \textbf{Campus Map} designating several possible locations players
may visit during the game. Each location should be labeled with
a letter/number pair matching the sectors of the \textbf{Galaxy Chart}.
(If only eight locations are available, each location can be associated
with two sectors. Note that only sectors 
A1, A3, B3, C1,
C2, C3, D2 are used.)

For example:
