Here are some guidelines for local campuses on how to prepare for and
run the event.

  \item 0:00 - Staff arrives
  \item 0:15 - Team check-in
  \item 0:45 - Orientation

  \item 5:00 - Dismissal
\end{itemize}

\phSection{Volunteers}

Only a handful of volunteers are required to run Game Control. We recommend
have 2-5 faculty depending on the number of participating teams, with
any number of student volunteers.

\phSection{Classroom Space}

A large \textbf{lecture hall} is recommended for running Check-in,
Orientation, and the Wrap-Up. Game Control can be stationed there during
the game as well.

Each team should be given a separate \textbf{classroom} so that they may
openly collaborate with teammates without spoiling puzzles for other teams.
It is useful to affix \textbf{printed signs} on each classroom and Game
Control to help players navigate your space, as well as any additional
signage required to get around.

\phSection{Team Supplies}

\textbf{Scissors and tape} should be provided in each classroom.
In addition, \textbf{chalk or whiteboard markers} should be provided if
teams will have access to chalkboards or whiteboards in their room.
Some campuses provide \textbf{pencils and notepads} to players.
We recommend \textbf{inviting teams to bring additional supplies}, such as
graph paper, colored pencils, and simple calculators. 

Note that teams may also choose to bring smartphones, laptops, cameras,
and so on. Due to the wide availability of such technology (particularly
phones), we discourage campuses from banning outside equipment, but also
do not suggest to explicitly recommend such items as they aren't required
to enjoy or be competitive in this game. The puzzles are
designed so that they generally cannot be solved using Google or 
brute force methods. (Savvy programmers might be able to write code to
help optimize their team's Bonus Puzzle solutions, which is why the Bonus
Puzzle is only used to break ties.)

\phSection{Copies}

All puzzles are designed to be printed/copied in \textbf{grayscale}, both
for the convience of campuses and for accessibility by players.
It is recommended to print copies for at least
\textbf{two more teams than you expect to participate} as extras, depending
on your access to last-minute copying.

You should have two separate PDFs: a complete \textbf{game book} that you're
currently reading, and a \textbf{puzzle packet} to be distributed to players.
We recommend printing \textbf{one game book per volunteer} in a binder,
and \textbf{one stapled puzzle packet per player}. 

\phSection{Check-in}

\textbf{Each player} should receive their \textbf{Puzzle Packet}.
They should also receive
a \textbf{pencil} and \textbf{notepad} for use during the Opening Puzzle
and the rest of the game.

Teams' devices should be set up with the ClueKeeper app and Hunt Code. Some
campuses have players use their own phones; other campuses provide
iPads.

Some campuses also choose to distribute other giveaways/swag/brochures
at registration. Many bookstores are willing to provide branded disposable
bags to help distribute materials.

Teams should be directed to their assigned classroom (``Headquarters/TeamHQ'') where they can
drop off everything except the provided packet, pencil, and notepad.
They should then return to Game Control's lecture hall to await Orientation.

\phSection{Orientation}

The \textbf{Rules} should be reviewed, and any questions from players
should be answered. In particular, boundaries for where players are allowed
to travel during the game should be established.

Once everyone is ready, present teams with the Start Code that will allow them
to begin solving puzzles and start the game timer. 

\phSection{Gameplay}

As clues are unlocked in ClueKeeper, players will be able to solve puzzles
and input their solutions into ClueKeeper, earning points. Progress
may be monitored at ClueKeeper.com.

Campuses using Cluekeeper's GPS will have players traveling to locations
on campus to unlock Main Puzzles, unlock Cryptic Puzzles, solve the Metapuzzle,
and solve the Hidden Puzzle. 

A volunteer should stand at the door of Game Control to ensure at most
one team is allowed in Game Control at all times. 

Recreational teams are allowed to ask for hints at Game Control at any time
for any Main Puzzle, Cryptic Puzzle, or Metapuzzle. Game Control should ask
players to explain the work they've
done thus far, and give a single hint that should help the team make some
amount of progress. Different teams may receive different hints for the same
puzzle depending on their progress.

Competitive teams can ask for clarifications about the rules, but generally
they should not receive hints outside of those provided by ClueKeeper.

Each team is allowed three submissions of the Bonus Puzzle. Generally this
puzzle should be judged by Game Control in front of the players to confirm
the validity of the submission. 
Only the best submission from each team is used. If the game has ended
with multiple teams in line for Game Control, all submissions for all teams
should be collected as quickly as possible and graded. Teams may not submit
multiple Bonus Puzzle solutions after the game has ended.

\phSection{Food}

Campuses that will be running the event through lunchtime are encouraged to
provide a \textbf{pizza lunch} for players. This lunch should not interrupt the
game; rather, players should be able to grab a bite to eat to have while they
continue to solve puzzles. In addition, \textbf{snacks}
(fruit, granola bars, etc.) and \textbf{drinks} (bottled water) are nice for
players to have access to during the game. Don't forget to provide
appropriate \textbf{plates, cutlery, napkins, and trashbags}.

This food can be distributed at a \textbf{central location near Game Control}
(but not inside Game Control's room).

\phSection{Wrap-Up and Awards}

At the end of the game, teams should straighten up their classrooms before
returning to Game Control for the Wrap-Up. \textbf{Trash bags} may be
provided for this purpose.

Teams should line up outside Game Control until results have been tabulated.
Once all results have been determined, teams may be seated inside Game Control.

Solutions need not be reviewed together; instead, the full game book can be provided
to teachers for follow-up/extension at a later date.

Awards for Recreational/Competitive teams are treated completely separately
if both Leagues are present.
\textbf{Certificates} should be distributed in 
random or alphabetical order to all teams placing
below 3rd place. A \textbf{3rd Place Certificate/Trophy} is then awarded.
After reminding the 1st place team to be respectful, a
\textbf{2nd Place Certificate/Trophy} is then awarded, followed by the
\textbf{1st Place Certificate/Trophy}. Opportunities for photographs should
be allowed during this process and after dismissal.

After awards are done, teams may be dismissed.

\phSection{Social Media}

Players/teachers/volunteers can be encouraged to tag \texttt{@MaPPmath}
and \texttt{\#Challenge19} on Twitter with non-spoiler posts/media during
and after the event.
