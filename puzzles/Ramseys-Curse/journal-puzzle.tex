Nice Job!
If you look at the cost along with the total number of chambers, you should get coordinates corresponding to all of the sites.
\begin{itemize}
        \item Site 1: \((7,19)\)
        \item Site 2: \((4,21)\)
        \item Site 3: \((6,12)\)
        \item Site 4: \((5,11)\)
\end{itemize}

With this information we should be able to plot the correct coordinates on journal entry 3. The hidden message is then the combination of two of the following words:
BACKPACK, COMPASS, FLASHLIGHT, HAT, MAP, ROPE.
