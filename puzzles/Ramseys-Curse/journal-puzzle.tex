Nice Job!
If you look at the cost along with the total number of chambers, you should get coordinates corresponding to all of the sites.
\begin{itemize}
        \item Site 1: \((6,19)\)
        \item Site 2: \((5,21)\)
        \item Site 3: \((5,12)\)
        \item Site 4: \((4, 11)\)
\end{itemize}
I also found this while looking in Dr. Jonas' notes:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Site 1 adjustment: left 3, down 16.
        \item Site 2 adjustment: right 5, down 15.
        \item Site 3 adjustment: right 6, down 1.
        \item Site 4 adjustment: left 1, down 1.
\end{itemize}

With all of this we should be able to plot the correct coordinates on journal entry 3. The hidden message is then the combination of two of the following words:
BACKPACK, COMPASS, FLASHLIGHT, HAT, MAP, ROPE.
