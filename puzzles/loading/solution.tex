From the top to bottom of the Galaxy Chart, several words are written in an
alien language:

\texttt{HFR PBQR JBEQ EBOBG NG YBJRE YRSG FLFGRZ GB FBYIR UVQQRA CHMMYR}

By applying the ROT-13 cipher to all these words, the following message
is revealed:

\texttt{USE CODE WORD ROBOT AT LOWER LEFT SYSTEM TO SOLVE HIDDEN PUZZLE}

In ClueKeeper, this can be solved by using the ``LOADING...'' clue that
appears partway into the game. At GPS campuses, players should visit the
location associated with the lower-left system (DULL) and enter \texttt{ROBOT}.
At non-GPS campuses, players should enter \texttt{DULL+ROBOT}.
