Great news! I've finally received a message from Dr. Jonas.

Unfortunately, it's encrypted. Of course. All I'm able to get
out of it so far is the following line: ``Use the four secret words
found in my most cryptic journal entries to solve my final
puzzle.''

If you can figure out the twelve-letter solution to Dr. Jonas's final
puzzle, I think we'll finally know what happened to our missing
professor! -BF
