Team, I'm so sorry. I was too afraid to trust you before, but after
seeing how many puzzles you've solved, I think I can finally tell
you the truth.

In a stunning twist none of you expected, I'm convinced that Dr.
Jonas has been abducted by extraterrestrials! I have a final
message from her on my computer, but of course it's encrypted
by a 12-letter keyword. The only clue I have from her is this:
``Use the four secret words
found in my particularly cryptic journal entries to solve my final
puzzle.''

I'm begging you, please help me figure out this keyword
so we can finally solve the mystery of our missing
professor! -BF
