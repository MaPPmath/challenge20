Good work finding all four solutions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Arena 1: sG-rF-qE
\item Arena 2: uE-vD-wC-xB-yA-zF
\item Arena 3: nD-jE-kF-lG-mB-hC
\item Arena 4: tC-uD-oA-pB
\end{itemize}

Looking at the June journal entry, I can't help but notice
the strange year used: 3513. 
Here's an idea: label the columns of this entry
with the letters A through G, and the rows h through z. Then
maybe you can use the arena solutions and the number 3513
to extract a hidden message? -BF
