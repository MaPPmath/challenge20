          & Succesful & dig & today. & We & found & a \\
  \hline
  lot & of & pot & shards, & some & with & remarkably \\
  \hline
  intact & artwork. & Like & in & the & tomb, & there \\
  \hline
  are & scenes & of & men & with & circles & around \\
  \hline
  their & heads, & looking & to & the & sky. & We \\
  \hline
  believe & these & represent & past & kings, & deities, & or \\
  \hline
  maybe & both. & I & recall & my & advisor's & words, \\
  \hline
  ``people & are & not & pots.'' & I & should & be \\
  \hline
  careful & before & drawing & any & firm & conclusions. & On \\
  \hline
  the & other & end & of & the & site & from \\
  \hline
  the & tomb & we & found & a & burial & site. \\
  \hline
  It & was & lined & with & red & ochre, & the \\
  \hline
  bodies & were & facing & east & with & their & arms \\
  \hline
  folded. & Already & this & site & has & yielded & so \\
  \hline
  much. & If & only & the & university & understood. & They \\
  \hline
  want & to & save & money & so & badly, & but \\
  \hline
  what & is & it & for & if & not & this? \\
