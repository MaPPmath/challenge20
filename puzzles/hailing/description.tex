Zounds! Your ship has intercepted an extraterrestrial message of
\textbf{Bleeps and Bloops}, where each octagon
represents a \textit{long} bleep and each circle represents
a \textit{short} bloop.

Communications Officer Uhuna says she's still working
on translating the communiqu\'e, but at first glance the message
seems to translate to the following seven words when ordered
alphabetically.

\begin{itemize}
\item CREWMEN (3rd letter)
\item DYE (3rd letter)
\item MATT (2nd letter)
\item REWIRE (5th letter)
\item SWEATED (2nd letter)
\item URNS (3rd letter)
\item WENCH (1st letter)
\end{itemize}

Wait, \texttt{EEARWNW}?
Well, that certainly doesn't seem to be useful information.
Perhaps there's more to \textit{space travel} than meets the eye...
