The Skolem people of Mesopotamia had many myths and legends.
Of gret interest to Dr. Jonas was the story of queen Noether, famed for her ability to barter with traders and merchants.
You may have met a good haggler or two in your day, but they didn't have to deal with the strange ways of the Skolem Bazaar.
The Skolem people had no money, instead goods were exchanged for other goods.
Moreoever, at the start of each day the shopkeepers would declare their exchange rates.
They were notoriously stubborn and would not change these rates no matter what happened.

Dr. Jonas believed that Noether was real, and wanted to learn as much about her as possible.
Unfortunately, over time every story about Noether split into multiple versions.
In one, Noether entered the marketplace with one bag of spice.
\begin{itemize}
\item The first shopkeeper declared that 1 bag of spice is equivalent to 4 shell bracelets and 1 clay cup. (\(S \leftrightarrow 4B + C\))
