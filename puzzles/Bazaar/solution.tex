Story 1:  IIPIP
\begin{enumerate}
\item Impossible. If each pomegrante is worth \$1, each fish is worth \$1, and each loaf of bread is worth \$2, then shopkeepers 1 and 3 keep the worth the same, and shopkeeper two changes the worth in increments of \$3. So there is no way to go from \$1 to \$2.
\item Impossible.
\item Possible, shop 1 \(\rightarrow\) shop 2 \(rightarrow\) shop 3 \(\rightarrow\) shop 1.
\item Impossible.
\item Possible, shop 1 \(\rightarrow\) shop 2 \(rightarrow\) shop 3.
\end{enumerate}

Story 2: PPIIP
\begin{enumerate}
\item Possible, shop 1 \(\rightarrow\) shop 2 \(rightarrow\) shop 3 \(\rightarrow\) shop 1.
\item Possible.
\item Impossible. Consider \(S + V\). Shop 1 increments this by 2, and shops 2 and 3 don't change this. There is no way to go from 0 to 1.
\item Impossible.
\item Possible, shop 1 \(\rightarrow\) shop 2 \(\rightarrow\) shop 1.
\end{enumerate}

Story 3: IIIPP
\begin{enumerate}
\item Impossible, look at \(B + V\). It does not change.
\item Impossible.
\item Impossible.
\item Possible, shop 1 \(\rightarrow\) shop 2 \(\rightarrow\) shop 1 \(\rightarrow\) shop 3 \(\rightarrow\) shop 3 \(rightarrow\) shop 2.
\item Possible.
\end{enumerate}

Journal Cipher: IIPIP, PPIIP, IIIPP becomes 00101, 11001, 00011, which in turn is E, Y, C.
