Nicely done!
You figured out which of the trades were possible (P)
or impossible (I) for each market. 
What if we organize that information like this, letting
\(P=1\) and \(I=0\):

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|ccc|cc}
& Village M. & M. Square & Black M. & Binary \\\hline
\#1 & P & P & I & 110 & \\
\#2 & I & P & I \\ % 010 2
\#3 & P & I & I \\ % 100 4
\#4 & I & I & P \\ % 001 1
\#5 & I & P & P % 011 3
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Each binary number with
three digits is equal to a number between \(0\) and \(7\),
and those are the exact numbers found in the September journal
entry. That's not a QR code - it's another hidden message from
Dr. Jonas!

I'll leave it to you to figure out how to use the five numbers
from the chart above to solve the September puzzle, but I have
a feeling that binary isn't the only code involved here...
