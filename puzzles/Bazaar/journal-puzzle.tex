Great work on Main Puzzle 2! I think we can use your answer
to extract a hidden password from Journal Entry 2.

In each story, you figured out which of the statements 1-5 were Possible (P)
or Impossible (I). What if we organize that information like this,
using \(I=0,P=1\):

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|ccc|cc}
& Story 1 & Story 2 & Story 3 & Binary & Decimal \\\hline
Statement 1 & P & P & I & 110 & 6 \\
Statement 2 & I & P & I \\ % 010 2
Statement 3 & P & I & I \\ % 100 4
Statement 4 & I & I & P \\ % 001 1
Statement 5 & I & P & P % 011 3
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

I think we're supposed to cut out the lower square, and then further
cut out the rectangles that match those numbers. What will happen
if we place that cut-out on the barcode-looking thing above it?
Maybe the Code Sheet will help us decipher the resulting \(2\times 3\)
rectangles?
