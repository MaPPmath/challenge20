Great work on Main Puzzle 2! I think we can use your answer
to extract a hidden password from Journal Entry 2.

In each story, you figured out which of the statements 1-5 were Possible (P)
or Impossible (I). What if we organize that information like this:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|ccc|cc}
& Story 1 & Story 2 & Story 3 & Binary & 0-7 \\\hline
Statement 1 & I & P & I & 010 & 2 \\
Statement 2 & P & P & I \\ % 110 6
Statement 3 & I & I & I \\ % 000 0
Statement 4 & P & P & P \\ % 111 7
Statement 5 & I & P & P % 011 3
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

I think we're supposed to cut out the lower square, and then further
cut out the rectangles that match those numbers. What will happen
if we place that cut-out on the barcode-looking thing above it?
Maybe the Code Sheet will help us decipher the resulting \(2\times 3\)
rectangles?
