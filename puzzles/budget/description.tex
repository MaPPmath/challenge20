Maybe it's nothing, but looking through my emails from Dr. Jonas,
this one stuck out to me in particular as being possibly related
to her journal... 

\textit{Great news, we got funded! I put in requests to three different funding agencies,
and they each agreed to cover the exact cost of three or four expenses from our budget.}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\textbf{Funding Agency}               & \textbf{Amount} & \textbf{Budget Code Adjustment} \\\hline
National Science Foundation           & \$36,191        & +5\\
National Endowment for the Humanities & \$14,006        & +2\\
Archaeological Institute of America   & \$22,260        & -1
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

If anyone can work it out, it's you folks. -BF
