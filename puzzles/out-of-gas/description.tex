Uh-oh... unfortunately, you have now found yourself stranded
in a stretch of empty space with no fuel left! Maybe these firefly-class
engines aren't all they're cracked up to be...

Luckily for you,
your ship's \textit{amazing} engineer Faylee does have one trick that
just might save your team. There is
an emergency reserve tank that can be unlocked by utilizing the
\textbf{Reserve Tank Switchboard}, if you can puzzle out the meaning
of the following image...

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[x=0.5in,y=0.5in]
\fill[white] (0,0) rectangle (3,2);
\draw[step=1,black!30] (0,0) grid (3,2);
\node at (1.5,1.5) {\LARGE b};
\node at (0.5,1.5) {\LARGE i};
\node at (0.5,0.5) {\LARGE n};
\node at (1.5,0.5) {\LARGE a};
\node at (2.5,0.5) {\LARGE r};
\node at (2.5,1.5) {\LARGE y};
\foreach \coor in {
  {(2,0)},
  {(1,1)},
  {(2,1)}
}{ \fill[opacity=0.3] \coor rectangle +(1,1); }
\node[circle,draw=black,fill=white,inner sep=1pt] at (1.5,1) {35};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
