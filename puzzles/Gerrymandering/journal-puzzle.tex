Amazing!

While you were working, I managed to find the general locations of the tribes in
Dr. Jonas's notes. I've added the information you found counting the number
of provinces within each tribe.
\begin{itemize}
\item Tribe A (7 provinces): North-by-Northeast
\item Tribe B (5 provinces): East-by-Southeast
\item Tribe C (5 provinces): South-by-Southwest
\item Tribe D (6 provinces): West-by-Southwest
\item Tribe E (3 provinces): West-by-Northwest
\end{itemize}

I'm betting this is another one of Dr. Jonas's codes. Can you use another
journal page to find the ruler
of each tribe, and use the number of provinces to choose a letter from the
first name of each ruler?

%While you were busy drawing those districts, we dug up some instructions on how to get a message from that list of rulers of journal entry 4.
%Dr. Jonas hid a message in some of the names of the Rulers of the Skolem people.
%The number of districts of the tribe will tell you general directions on where the letters are (for example go left 5 or go right 3), but we have the starting points here on our side.
%Let's see what it says!

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Recall that tribe B had 7 districts. Grab the 7th letter of the name of the final ruler on the list. Ignore spaces.
%\item Tribe C had 5 districts. Look at the last ruler of the Kel dynasty. Grab the fifth to last letter of their first name.
%\item Tribe D also had 5 districts. Now look at the last ruler of the Dheub dynasty. Go 5 letters left from the h in Dheub, ignoring spaces. This is the third letter.
%\item Tribe E had 6 districts. Find the only ruler with Skolem in their name on the list. Go 6 letters to the right of their first name, ignoring spaces.
%\item The final letter comes from the name of the first ruler of the Lewo dyansty. Tribe F had 3 districts. Starting at the letter m in their name, go right three letters.
