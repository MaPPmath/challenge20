Amazing!
While you were busy drawing those districts, we dug up some instructions on how to get a message from that list of rulers of journal entry 4.
Dr. Jonas hid a message in some of the names of the Rulers of the Skolem people.
The number of districts of the tribe will tell you general directions on where the letters are (for example go left 5 or go right 3), but we have the starting points here on our side.
Let's see what it says!

\begin{itemize}
\item Recall that tribe B had 7 districts. Grab the 7th letter of the name of the final ruler on the list. Ignore spaces.
\item Tribe C had 5 districts. Look at the last ruler of the Kel dynasty. Grab the fifth to last letter of their first name.
\item Tribe D also had 5 districts. Now look at the last ruler of the Dheub dynasty. Go 5 letters left from the h in Dheub, ignoring spaces. This is the third letter.
\item Tribe E had 6 districts. Find the only ruler with Skolem in their name on the list. Go 6 letters to the right of their first name, ignoring spaces.
\item The final letter comes from the name of the first ruler of the Lewo dyansty. Tribe F had 3 districts. Starting at the letter m in their name, go right three letters.
\end{itemize}
