Amazing!
While you were busy drawing those districts, we dug up some instructions on how to get a message from that list of rulers of journal entry 4.
Let's see what it says!

\begin{itemize}
        \item Go to the last ruler on the list. Use the number of districts from tribe B. Starting at the left, go that position in their name, ingoring spaces.
        \item Go to the last ruler of the Kel Dynasty. Use the number of districts from tribe C. Go that many places back from the end of their first name.
        \item Go the final ruler of the Dheub dynasty. Use the number of districts from tribe D. Starting at the h in Dheub go left that many places.
        \item Find the only ruler on the list with Skolem in their name. Use the number of districts from tribe E. Go that many places back from the end of their name.
        \item Find the first ruler of Lewo dynasty. Use the number of districts from tribe F. Go to the start of the second syllable of the first name. Then go right by the number of districts.
