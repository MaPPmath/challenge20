Okay, this is weird. I just received the following text from Dr. Jonas's phone!

\textit{i must be out of my SKULL. i thought that i had LOST it in October,
back at that TEMPLE. that SNAKE must have found the CRYSTAL. this truly
is my holy GRAIL. i'll follow it to my DOOM.}

Frankly, it seems like nonsense, but maybe it's the clue to understanding another
journal entry? -BF
