As your adventures continue, your ship comes across a \textbf{Mysterious
Message}, projected onto the stars themselves! You put on a John
Williams soundtrack, but to no avail, as the strange communication
frankly doesn't make any sense. It's as though nine of the
words don't belong...

You contact Jan Duet, who says this isn't the first time she's
come across such a message. However, while she's gone
to great \textit{lengths} to decipher the true meaning of
these dispatches, she hasn't been able to understand their intent.

Wait! Maybe that's it? It turns out that solving this puzzle
is easy as \textit{pie}...
