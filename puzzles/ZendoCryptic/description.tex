This mostly ordinary journal has strange doodles at the start of each line.
In fact these are pictures of early dice from the Heyting people, or at least some of them are.
Dr. Jonas was a Heyting expert, so there is no way she drew incorrect dice on accident.
Both of the dates at the beginning look wrong as well.
Dr. Jonas must have put them there for some other purpose.
