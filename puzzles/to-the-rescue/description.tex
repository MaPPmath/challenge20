Finally, it's time to take on the Malevolent Monarch Blurg!
There's only one problem... no one seems to know where Blurg's
home system is located.

Your only clues are the meticulous designs of the
\textbf{Enemy Insignias} worn by Blurg's henchmen,
and Blurg's eight codewords hidden throughout the galaxy.
Each insignia represents one of Blurg's outpost systems,
but where could Blurg's own base be located?

This is no time to be toying around! Defeat the Malevolent Monarch
by visiting his home system and submitting the final
codeword that can be extracted from the four insignias!
