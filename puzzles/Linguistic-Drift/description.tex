Language changes over time, sometimes in strange ways.
In this journal page Dr. Jonas was considering the changes in an ancient script over a period of 450 years and then 600 years.
It looks like she hid a message in the unfinished 600 year group.

Here is a brief crash course in linguistics: you can expect a major change to occur every 150 years.
Keep an eye out for changes in boundaries, contractions, and expansions.
Good luck!
